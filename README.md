# Blogging Platform Backend

## Overview

This project is a fully functional backend for a blogging platform built with **Ruby on Rails**. It demonstrates expertise in setting up and managing **relational databases**, implementing secure **user authentication**, and ensuring that all responses are seamlessly integrated with the frontend. The platform allows users to register, log in, and create posts, showcasing a developer's ability to handle the full lifecycle of backend development.

## Features

### 1. Relational Database Setup

- Designed and implemented a **relational database schema** using ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL.
- Established a **one-to-many relationship** between `users` and `posts`:

  - Each user can create multiple posts (`user_id` foreign key in the `posts` table).
  - Example:

    ```ruby
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      has_many :posts
    end

    class Post < ApplicationRecord
      belongs_to :user
    end
    ```

- Ensured database integrity with appropriate migrations, validations, and indexing for efficient queries.

### 2. User Authentication

- Implemented secure **login and signup functionality** using Railsâ€™ `has_secure_password` and `bcrypt`:
  - Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the `users` table.
  - Users can log in with their email and password to create, edit, and delete their posts.
- Built middleware to authenticate users before granting access to restricted resources:

  ```ruby
  before_action :authenticate_user

  private

  def authenticate_user
    render json: { error: "Unauthorized" }, status: :unauthorized unless current_user
  end
  ```

3. API Endpoints
   Developed robust and RESTful API endpoints to handle CRUD operations for users and posts:
   Users API:
   POST /users to create a new user.
   POST /sessions to handle user login and generate secure tokens.
   Posts API:
   GET /posts to fetch all posts.
   POST /posts to create a new post (requires authentication).
   PUT /posts/:id to update an existing post (authorization required).
   DELETE /posts/:id to delete a post (authorization required).
4. Frontend Integration
   Ensured that all API responses returned clean, structured, and appropriate JSON data for the frontend to consume:
   json
   Copy code
   {
   "id": 1,
   "title": "My First Post",
   "body": "This is an example post body.",
   "image": "https://example.com/image.png",
   "user": {
   "id": 1,
   "name": "John Doe",
   "email": "john@example.com"
   }
   }
   Handled edge cases such as invalid data submissions, unauthorized access, and resource not found with descriptive error messages.
5. Testing
   Wrote comprehensive RSpec tests for all models and controllers:
   Validated relationships between users and posts.
   Tested user authentication flow, ensuring secure login and session handling.
   Verified all API responses for accuracy and integrity.
